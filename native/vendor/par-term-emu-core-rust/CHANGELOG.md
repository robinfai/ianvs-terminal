## [Unreleased]

## [0.41.1] - 2026-04-11

### Changed
- **Dependency updates across all three sub-projects**:
  - **Rust** (`Cargo.toml`): bumped pyo3 0.28.2→0.28.3, tokio 1.50→1.51, tokio-tungstenite 0.28→0.29, clap 4.5.60→4.6.0, uuid 1.22→1.23, image 0.25.9→0.25.10, swash 0.2.6→0.2.7, nix 0.31→0.31.2, proptest 1.10→1.11, tempfile 3.26→3.27, plus patch bumps (libc, subtle, zeroize, sysinfo, tar, tracing-subscriber, unicode-segmentation). No source changes required — all API-compatible.
  - **Python** (`pyproject.toml`): bumped pillow 12.1.1→12.2.0, maturin 1.12.6→1.13.1, pytest 9.0.2→9.0.3, rich 14.3.3→14.3.4, ruff 0.15.5→0.15.10.
  - **Frontend** (`web-terminal-frontend/package.json`): bumped next 16.1.6→16.2.3, react/react-dom 19.2.4→19.2.5, typescript 5.9.3→6.0.2 (major), @bufbuild/buf 1.66→1.67, @tailwindcss/postcss + tailwindcss 4.2.1→4.2.2, @types/node 25.3→25.6, postcss 8.5.8→8.5.9.

### Fixed
- **Flaky coprocess tests**: Replaced fixed `thread::sleep(200ms)` with a `poll_until(timeout_ms, fn)` helper (10ms poll interval, 2s deadline) throughout the coprocess test suite in both `src/coprocess.rs` and `tests/test_coprocess.rs`. Fixed-duration sleeps raced the OS scheduler under parallel CPU contention, causing intermittent `Some(true) vs Some(false)` status failures on loaded CI boxes. The full suite now passes 3/3 back-to-back runs. Affects: `test_coprocess_write_read`, `test_coprocess_feed_output`, `test_coprocess_dead_process`, `test_coprocess_stderr_capture`, `test_coprocess_auto_cleanup_never_policy`, `test_coprocess_restart_always_policy`, `test_coprocess_restart_on_failure_clean_exit`, `test_coprocess_restart_on_failure_nonzero_exit`, `test_coprocess_no_copy_output`.
- **Terminal.tsx reconnect forward-reference**: `scheduleRetry` called `connect()` before `connect` was declared (TDZ / `react-hooks/refs` violation). Introduced a `connectRef` forward-reference synced via `useEffect` so scheduled reconnects always invoke the current closure.
- **TerminalDebug.tsx ref-during-render**: The debug overlay read `debugLogs.current.length` during render, which React disallows. Replaced with a `logCount` state updated when logs are pushed.
- **page.tsx inline component definition**: `StatusIndicator` was defined inside the `Home` component body, so it was re-created every render and would reset its own state. Hoisted to module scope alongside a new `STATUS_CONFIG` table and now takes `status` as a prop.
- **Flaky `test_ioctl_returns_updated_size`**: Replaced fixed `time.sleep(0.3)` / `time.sleep(0.5)` windows with a `wait_for_either` poll loop (50ms interval, 5s deadline) that watches the subprocess log file for SIGWINCH / poll markers. Under CPU contention the fixed sleeps raced the scheduler and the spawned Python interpreter had not yet written its log line.
- **Slow `test_very_large_terminal`**: Added `@pytest.mark.timeout(30)` override — rendering a 200×100 (20k-cell) terminal to PNG legitimately takes 6-9s under CPU contention, exceeding the 5s global pytest timeout. The default stays tight for fast tests.

### Build / Tooling
- **Frontend lint migrated from `next lint` to standalone ESLint**: Next.js 16 removed the `next lint` subcommand. Added `eslint@^9.39.4` + `eslint-config-next@^16.2.3` as dev dependencies, replaced legacy `.eslintrc.json` with flat-config `eslint.config.mjs`, and updated the `lint` npm script to `eslint .`. Downgraded two compiler-focused `react-hooks` v7 rules (`set-state-in-effect`, `preserve-manual-memoization`) from `error` to `warn` — they are calibrated for React-Compiler codebases and fire false-positives on idiomatic Next.js SSR hydration and pre-Compiler useCallback patterns.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-03-11

### Added
- **`TriggerAction::SplitPane` and `ActionResult::SplitPane`**: New trigger action that instructs the frontend to open a split pane. Supports `direction` (`horizontal`/`vertical`), `focus_new_pane`, `target` (`active`/`source`), and optional `command` (either `SendText` or `InitialCommand`). Polled via `poll_action_results()` which returns dicts with `type="split_pane"`.
  - New supporting types: `TriggerSplitDirection`, `TriggerSplitTarget`, `TriggerSplitCommand` (all re-exported from `terminal` module)
  - Python `TriggerAction("split_pane", {...})` fully handled: `to_trigger_action()` parses all params; `poll_action_results()` serialises the result dict
  - Python binding `split_pane()` added to expose the action from Python

## [0.40.0] - 2026-03-08

### Added
- **VT100 ACS (Alternate Character Set) line-drawing support**: Applications like tmux that fall back from UTF-8 to ACS line-drawing now render correct box-drawing glyphs instead of raw ASCII letters.
  - `ESC ( 0` / `ESC ( B`: designate G0 charset as DEC Line Drawing / ASCII
  - `ESC ) 0` / `ESC ) B`: designate G1 charset as DEC Line Drawing / ASCII
  - `SO` (0x0E) / `SI` (0x0F): shift active charset to G1 / G0
  - Full 22-entry ACS→Unicode mapping applied in `write_char` when active charset is DecLineDrawing

### Fixed
- **Streaming `result_large_err` suppression**: Added self-documenting comments explaining why `#[allow(clippy::result_large_err)]` is used in WebSocket handshake callbacks — the `ErrorResponse` type is fixed by the tungstenite `Callback` trait and cannot be reduced or boxed.

## [0.39.8] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **PTY env var stripping**: Fixed the re-apply loop to skip `DROP_VARS` so that stripped multiplexer env vars (TMUX, TMUX_PANE, STY, WINDOW, COLUMNS, LINES) are not re-added by the parent env re-application step.

## [0.39.7] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **PTY env var stripping**: Fixed environment variable removal for multiplexer vars (TMUX, TMUX_PANE, STY, WINDOW, COLUMNS, LINES). The previous approach of skipping vars during iteration didn't work because `CommandBuilder::new()` pre-loads the full parent environment via `get_base_env()`. Now uses `env_remove()` to explicitly remove unwanted vars after base env is loaded.

## [0.39.6] - 2026-03-05

### Fixed
- **Streaming `screen_cleared` subscription**: Python clients could not subscribe to `"screen_cleared"` events via the streaming protocol because the string-to-EventType mapping was missing. The reverse conversion (EventType to string) worked, so events were emitted but unsubscribable.

### Docs
- Updated README, SECURITY.md, and CROSS_PLATFORM.md to document PTY multiplexer env var stripping (TMUX, TMUX_PANE, STY, WINDOW)

## [0.39.5] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **`child_pid()` on `PtySession`**: New method that returns the PID of the spawned child process (shell or command) as `int | None`. Useful for process management (sending signals, monitoring, etc.).

### Fixed
- **PTY environment leakage**: Child PTY processes now strip tmux (`TMUX`, `TMUX_PANE`) and GNU Screen (`STY`, `WINDOW`) environment variables from the parent. Previously these leaked into spawned shells, causing tools like fzf to render in the parent multiplexer pane instead of the embedded PTY.

## [0.39.4] - 2026-03-04

### Added
- **ScreenCleared terminal event**: New event emitted when ED 2J (clear screen) or ED 3J (clear screen + scrollback) is received. Frontends can use this to invalidate scrollback zone/mark metadata so the scrollbar stays consistent with terminal state.
  - New `TerminalEvent::ScreenCleared { include_scrollback: bool }` variant
  - New `poll_screen_cleared_events()` method on Terminal to drain these events
  - Streaming protocol support with new `screen_cleared` message type and `ScreenCleared` event subscription
  - Python binding: `poll_screen_cleared_events()` returns `list[bool]`
- **OSC 133;C command extraction**: Shell integration now extracts the command text from `OSC 133;C;<command>` sequences sent by shell scripts before command execution markers.

### Changed
- **Login shell detection**: PTY session now detects `-l`/`--login` flags for shell spawning. (Note: portable-pty's CommandBuilder uses args[0] for both path resolution and arg0, so `$0` shows the shell path rather than `-bash`; the `-l` flag provides full login shell behavior regardless.)
- Added `nix` dependency (0.29) with process/term/signal features for Unix platforms

## [0.39.3] - 2026-02-25

### Fixed
- **Graphics scrollback clearing**: When clearing the terminal screen (ED 2) or screen including scrollback (ED 3), graphics stored in the scrollback buffer are now also properly cleared. Previously, only the active graphics were cleared, leaving orphaned graphics in scrollback.

## [0.39.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added
- **GitNexus MCP Integration**: Add code intelligence skills for exploring, debugging, impact analysis, and refactoring using the GitNexus knowledge graph
  - New skill files: `exploring/SKILL.md`, `debugging/SKILL.md`, `impact-analysis/SKILL.md`, `refactoring/SKILL.md`
  - Documentation added to `CLAUDE.md` and `AGENTS.md` with tool references and workflow guides
  - `.gitnexus` cache directory added to `.gitignore`

### Fixed
- **OSC52 empty clipboard writes**: Ignore empty clipboard write operations instead of processing them. Some applications send empty OSC52 sequences which should be no-ops.

## [0.39.1] - 2026-02-19

### Fixed
- **Increase OSC data size limit**: Raise `MAX_OSC_DATA_LENGTH` from 1 MB to 128 MB to support inline images via iTerm2/Kitty protocols. The previous limit silently dropped any image whose base64-encoded OSC sequence exceeded 1 MB (~750 KB raw).

## [0.39.0] - 2026-02-15

### Security
- **Constant-time auth comparisons (S-1, S-2)**: All API key and password comparisons now use `subtle::ct_eq()` to prevent timing attacks
- **API key query parameter disabled by default (S-3)**: Add `allow_api_key_in_query` config flag (default `false`) to `StreamingConfig` and CLI `--allow-api-key-in-query`. Query param API keys are logged by proxies and leaked via Referer headers; now opt-in only
- **Coprocess command injection prevention (S-4)**: Validate coprocess commands for shell metacharacters (`|;&$` etc.), path traversal (`..`), working directory traversal, and environment variable name format
- **Shell path validation (S-5)**: Validate `$SHELL` environment variable points to an existing file before use; fallback to `/bin/sh`
- **Image/graphics size limits (S-6 through S-9)**: Add `MAX_IMAGE_DIMENSION`, `MAX_IMAGE_DATA_SIZE`, `MAX_SIXEL_DIMENSION`, `MAX_SIXEL_COLORS`, and `GraphicsLimits` struct with configurable bounds for all graphics protocols
- **OSC string length limit (S-10)**: Add `MAX_OSC_DATA_LENGTH` (1MB) to reject oversized escape sequences
- **Clipboard size limit (S-11)**: Add `MAX_CLIPBOARD_CONTENT_SIZE` (10MB) to bound clipboard memory usage
- **TLS key permission validation (S-12)**: Warn on Unix when TLS private key file has group/world-readable permissions
- **Password file permission validation (S-13)**: Warn on Unix when htpasswd file has insecure permissions
- **Password memory zeroization (S-14)**: Add `zeroize` crate; `PasswordConfig` now zeroizes sensitive data on drop to prevent credential leakage in memory dumps
- **FFI safety documentation (S-15)**: Strengthen `SharedState::from_terminal()` safety contract documentation with pointer lifetime and exclusivity requirements
- **NaN handling in image size (Q-10)**: Image size `is_auto()` now handles NaN/Infinity correctly

### Fixed
- **Observer dispatch race (D-1)**: Fix duplicate event dispatch when `process()` is called multiple times before `poll_events()`. Events are now tracked with a dispatch index to prevent re-delivery to observers
- **Tab stop resize validation (Q-8)**: Guard tab stop array operations against zero-width terminal resize
- **Origin mode underflow (Q-9)**: Use `saturating_sub` in cursor positioning to prevent underflow when scroll region bounds are invalid
- **Scroll region return values (Q-7)**: `scroll_region_up()`/`scroll_region_down()` now return `bool` indicating success/failure
- **Clippy needless_return**: Fix clippy warning in `get_default_shell()`
- **Makefile: npm → bun**: Replace all `npm` commands with `bun` in web frontend targets (`web-install`, `web-dev`, `web-build`, `web-build-static`, `web-start`, `proto-typescript`) to match the project's actual package manager
- **Makefile: Add `test-rust-streaming` target**: Streaming Rust tests (69 additional tests) were never run; new target added to `test`, `checkall`, and help text
- **Missing `websockets` dev dependency**: Add `websockets` to `pyproject.toml` dev dependencies so streaming Python tests actually run instead of silently skipping
- **Streaming test skip guard**: Fix `test_streaming.py` skip logic to catch `RuntimeError`/`TypeError` (not just `ImportError`) when the streaming feature isn't compiled, so tests skip gracefully with `make dev`

### Added
- **Streaming server unit tests (T-1)**: 47 new tests for `validate_terminal_size()`, `HttpBasicAuthConfig::verify()`, `SessionRegistry` lifecycle, `StreamingConfig` defaults, and `ApiAuthConfig::is_configured()`
- **Recording system tests (T-5)**: 13 new tests for recording lifecycle, timestamp accuracy, event type recording, asciicast/JSON export format validation, and session ID uniqueness
- **Event system tests (T-4)**: 29 new tests for `TerminalEvent::kind()` exhaustive variant coverage, event queuing through `process()`/`poll_events()`, and event struct validation
- **HTML export tests (T-6)**: 20 new tests (up from 2) for text rendering, HTML escaping, text attributes (bold/italic/underline/strikethrough/dim/blink/hidden/reverse), color rendering, and wide characters
- **Search tests (T-8)**: 24 new tests (up from 2) for regex patterns, search options, match navigation, scrollback search, Unicode support, and API coverage
- **Python binding: `poll_upload_requests()`**: Add missing Python binding for `Terminal.poll_upload_requests()` to drain pending upload request events

### Changed
- **Dependencies**: Update all Rust, Python, and Node dependencies to latest versions. Notable: sysinfo 0.34→0.38, pyo3 0.28.1, ruff 0.15, maturin 1.12
- **MSRV**: Bump minimum supported Rust version from 1.75 to 1.88 (required by sysinfo 0.38)
- **Clippy auto-fix**: Replace `map_or(true, ...)` with `is_none_or(...)` in image deletion (Rust 1.82+)
- **CLAUDE.md**: Improve developer guidance with build commands, single-test examples, architecture overview, streaming protocol layers, and feature flags documentation

### Documentation
- **Instant Replay guide (DOC-1)**: New `docs/INSTANT_REPLAY.md` with SnapshotManager configuration, ReplaySession navigation, Python API reference, and memory tuning
- **C/C++ FFI guide (DOC-2)**: New `docs/FFI_GUIDE.md` with SharedCell/SharedState types, memory ownership rules, build instructions, and C code examples
- **Observer patterns guide (DOC-7)**: New `docs/OBSERVERS.md` with Rust/Python observer implementation, event categories, subscription filtering, and thread safety
- **Streaming Python examples (DOC-4)**: Add Python integration section to `docs/STREAMING.md` with StreamingConfig, TLS, and API key examples
- **README deduplication (DOC-5)**: Consolidate verbose "What's New" sections into brief summary pointing to CHANGELOG.md
- **BUILDING.md version fix (DOC-6)**: Remove stale version reference from title

## [0.38.0] - 2026-02-14

### Added
- **Instant Replay**: Add Instant Replay system with cell-level terminal snapshots, input-stream delta recording, and timeline navigation (Issue #47)
  - `TerminalSnapshot` and `GridSnapshot` structs capture complete terminal state (grids, cursors, colors, attributes, modes, scroll regions, tab stops) with memory size estimation
  - `Terminal::capture_snapshot()` and `Terminal::restore_from_snapshot()` for point-in-time state capture and restore
  - `SnapshotManager` manages a rolling buffer of snapshots with size-based eviction (default 4 MiB budget, 30-second interval), input-stream recording, `reconstruct_at()` for delta replay, and `find_entry_for_timestamp()` for timestamp-based lookup
  - `ReplaySession` provides timeline navigation with `seek_to()`, `step_forward()`, `step_backward()`, `seek_to_start()`, `seek_to_end()`, `seek_to_timestamp()`, `next_entry()`, and `previous_entry()`
  - Python binding: `capture_replay_snapshot()` returns dict with `timestamp`, `cols`, `rows`, `estimated_size_bytes`
- **General-Purpose File Transfer (OSC 1337 File= with inline=0)**: Full file download/upload support via the iTerm2 OSC 1337 `File=` protocol
  - New `FileTransfer` type and `FileTransferManager` with bounded ring buffer for completed transfers (default 32 entries, 50MB max size)
  - Downloads (`inline=0`): Base64 payload decoded, progress tracked, raw bytes stored for frontend retrieval via `take_completed_transfer()`
  - Multipart downloads (`MultipartFile`/`FilePart`): Chunked transfers routed through `FileTransferManager` with per-chunk progress events
  - Single-file downloads: Complete file received and stored in one step
  - Inline images (`inline=1`): Existing graphics path unchanged (no regression)
- **RequestUpload Protocol (OSC 1337 RequestUpload)**: Terminal-to-host file upload support
  - Host sends `RequestUpload=format=tgz`, terminal emits `upload_requested` event
  - Frontend responds via `send_upload_data(data)` (writes `ok\n` + base64 to PTY) or `cancel_upload()` (writes abort)
- **File Transfer Terminal Events**: Five new `TerminalEvent` variants: `FileTransferStarted`, `FileTransferProgress`, `FileTransferCompleted`, `FileTransferFailed`, `UploadRequested`
  - All events routed to `on_screen_event()` in the observer system
  - New `EventKind` variants for subscription filtering: `FileTransferStarted`, `FileTransferProgress`, `FileTransferCompleted`, `FileTransferFailed`, `UploadRequested`
- **Python Bindings: File Transfer API**: 9 new methods on both `Terminal` and `PtyTerminal`
  - Query: `get_active_transfers()`, `get_completed_transfers()`, `get_transfer(id)`
  - Retrieve: `take_completed_transfer(id)` (includes raw `data` bytes)
  - Control: `cancel_file_transfer(id)`, `send_upload_data(data)`, `cancel_upload()`
  - Config: `set_max_transfer_size(bytes)`, `get_max_transfer_size()`
- **Python Bindings: File Transfer Observer Events**: Observer callbacks receive `file_transfer_started`, `file_transfer_progress`, `file_transfer_completed`, `file_transfer_failed`, and `upload_requested` event dicts
- **Streaming Protocol: File Transfer Events**: Five new protobuf messages (`FileTransferStarted`, `FileTransferProgress`, `FileTransferCompleted`, `FileTransferFailed`, `UploadRequested`) and event types (`EVENT_TYPE_FILE_TRANSFER_STARTED=20` through `EVENT_TYPE_UPLOAD_REQUESTED=24`) for real-time WebSocket delivery
- **Python Bindings: Streaming File Transfer**: `encode_server_message()` and `decode_server_message()` support all 5 file transfer message types
- **Terminal Observer API**: New `TerminalObserver` trait enables push-based event delivery with deferred dispatch (events dispatched after `process()` returns). Supports category-specific callbacks (`on_zone_event`, `on_command_event`, `on_environment_event`, `on_screen_event`) plus catch-all `on_event`. Observer panic isolation via `catch_unwind` prevents one bad observer from crashing the terminal
- **Terminal Observer API: Subscription Filtering**: Observers can implement `subscriptions()` to receive only specific event kinds, avoiding unnecessary dispatch overhead
- **C-Compatible FFI**: New `SharedState` and `SharedCell` `#[repr(C)]` types provide a frozen snapshot of terminal state (dimensions, cursor, title, CWD, screen content with per-cell text/color/attributes) for C/C++ consumers. C API: `terminal_get_state()`, `terminal_free_state()`, `terminal_add_observer()`, `terminal_remove_observer()`
- **C FFI Observer Vtable**: `TerminalObserverVtable` struct with function pointers enables C consumers to register observers with `user_data` context pointer
- **Python Bindings: Sync Observer**: `Terminal.add_observer(callback, kinds=None)` registers a Python callable that receives event dicts after each `process()` call. Optional `kinds` parameter filters by event type
- **Python Bindings: Async Observer**: `Terminal.add_async_observer(kinds=None)` returns `(observer_id, asyncio.Queue)` tuple for async event consumption via `await queue.get()`
- **Python Bindings: Observer Management**: `Terminal.remove_observer(id)` and `Terminal.observer_count()` for observer lifecycle management
- **Python Convenience Wrappers**: `on_command_complete()`, `on_zone_change()`, `on_cwd_change()`, `on_title_change()`, `on_bell()` in `par_term_emu_core_rust.observers` module for common observer patterns

## [0.37.0] - 2026-02-13

### Added
- **Streaming Server: API Key Authentication**: New `api_key` field on `StreamingConfig` enables API key authentication for API routes (`/ws`, `/sessions`, `/stats`) while leaving static files (web frontend) unprotected. Accepted via `Authorization: Bearer <key>`, `X-API-Key: <key>` header, or `?api_key=<key>` query parameter. When both API key and HTTP Basic Auth are configured, either satisfies authentication. Wired from existing `--api-key` CLI flag (env: `PAR_TERM_API_KEY`). WebSocket-only server modes also validate auth during handshake
- **Streaming Server: Unified Auth Middleware**: New `ApiAuthConfig` struct and `api_auth_middleware` replace the old `basic_auth_middleware`, supporting both API key and HTTP Basic Auth in a single middleware. Auth is applied only to API routes via axum nested router pattern
- **Web Frontend: API Key Passthrough**: `getDefaultWsUrl()` now reads `api_key` from the page URL query params and appends it to the WebSocket URL, enabling `http://server:8099/?api_key=secret` to auto-authenticate the WS connection
- **Python Bindings: API Key Config**: `PyStreamingConfig` now exposes `api_key` as a constructor param (`api_key=None`) and getter/setter property. Masked as `api_key=***` in `__repr__`
- **Streaming Server: System Resource Statistics**: New optional system stats collection pushes CPU, memory, disk, network, and load average data to subscribed WebSocket clients. Enabled via `--enable-system-stats` CLI flag (env: `PAR_TERM_ENABLE_SYSTEM_STATS`) with configurable interval via `--system-stats-interval` (default 5s, env: `PAR_TERM_SYSTEM_STATS_INTERVAL`). Disabled by default
- **Streaming Server: Dedicated `/stats` Endpoint**: New WebSocket endpoint at `/stats` streams system stats as JSON to connected clients without requiring a terminal session. Requires `--enable-system-stats` flag. Provides CPU, memory, disk, network, load average, and host info at the configured interval
- **Streaming Protocol: `SystemStats` Message**: New `system_stats` server message type with nested `CpuStats`, `MemoryStats`, `DiskStats`, `NetworkInterfaceStats`, and `LoadAverage` structures. Includes static host info (hostname, OS name/version, kernel version) and dynamic metrics (CPU usage, memory, disk space, network I/O, load averages, uptime)
- **Streaming Protocol: `system_stats` Event Type**: New `EVENT_TYPE_SYSTEM_STATS = 18` for subscription filtering. Clients must subscribe to `system_stats` events to receive stats messages
- **Python Bindings: System Stats Config**: `PyStreamingConfig` now exposes `enable_system_stats` and `system_stats_interval_secs` as constructor params and getter/setter properties
- **Python Bindings: System Stats Decode**: `decode_server_message()` now returns full system stats data (cpu, memory, disks, networks, load_average, host info) as nested Python dicts/lists
- **Python Bindings: Missing Streaming Server Methods**: Added `send_cwd_changed()`, `send_trigger_matched()`, and `send_progress_bar_changed()` to `PyStreamingServer` for complete parity with Rust streaming server API
- **Kitty Graphics: Chunked Transmission**: Large images split across multiple DCS sequences are now properly accumulated and processed. Parser state persists on `Terminal` between chunks (`m=1` continues, `m=0` finalizes)
- **Kitty Graphics: Complete Delete Targets**: Implemented remaining `KittyDeleteTarget` variants — `AtCursor`, `InCell`, `OnScreen`, `ByColumn`, and `ByRow` now correctly remove graphics placements by position
- **Kitty Graphics: Placeholder Diacritics**: Unicode placeholder cells now include combining diacritics encoding row/column/MSB offsets in `Cell.combining`, enabling frontends to reconstruct full placeholder sequences
- **Screenshot: Synthetic Bold Rendering**: Bold text in screenshots is now visually emboldened using swash's `Render::embolden()` API (previously the `bold` parameter was accepted but ignored)
- **Screenshot: Font Load Failure Logging**: Emoji and CJK font load failures in the screenshot renderer now log error-level messages instead of being silently ignored

### Changed
- **Streaming Server: Auth middleware restructured** — `basic_auth_middleware` replaced by unified `api_auth_middleware` that handles both API key and HTTP Basic Auth. Auth is now applied only to API routes (`/ws`, `/sessions`, `/stats`) via nested router, leaving static file serving unprotected
- **Streaming: `PyPtyTerminal` methods gated with `#[cfg(feature = "streaming")]`** instead of `#[allow(dead_code)]` for clearer intent

### Removed
- Dead `DefaultSessionFactory` struct from streaming server (defined but never instantiated)
- Unused `advance_height` field from `GlyphMetrics` in screenshot font cache
- Unused `x_advance` and `y_advance` fields from `ShapedGlyph` in screenshot shaper

## [0.36.0] - 2026-02-11

### Added
- **Streaming Server: Per-Session Client Limits**: New `--max-clients-per-session` CLI flag and `PAR_TERM_MAX_CLIENTS_PER_SESSION` env var to cap concurrent clients per session (0 = unlimited). Enforced atomically via CAS loop in `try_add_client()`
- **Streaming Server: Input Rate Limiting**: New `--input-rate-limit` CLI flag and `PAR_TERM_INPUT_RATE_LIMIT` env var for per-client token bucket rate limiting (bytes/sec, 2x burst capacity). Applied to `Input` and `Paste` messages across all three WebSocket handlers (plain, TLS, Axum)
- **Streaming Server: Session Metrics**: New `SessionMetrics` struct tracks `messages_sent`, `bytes_sent`, `input_bytes`, `errors`, and `dropped_messages` per session with atomic counters. Metrics are included in `SessionInfo` for observability
- **Streaming Server: Terminal Size Validation**: `validate_terminal_size()` enforces bounds (2-1000 cols, 1-500 rows) on client resize requests and session creation. Invalid resize requests are logged and rejected
- **Streaming Server: Dead Session Reaping**: Session reaper now detects and cleans up sessions whose PTY process has exited and have no connected clients, via new `SessionFactory::is_session_alive()` trait method
- **Streaming Server: Broadcaster Health Check**: Reaper logs warnings when a session has active clients but no broadcast activity for 30+ seconds, aiding stalled broadcaster diagnosis
- **Streaming Server: `close_session()` Method**: New public method on `StreamingServer` handles session shutdown with delayed (500ms) factory teardown so clients receive the shutdown message
- **Streaming Server: WebSocket Query Parsing**: Plain and TLS listeners now use `accept_hdr_async` to capture URI query parameters during WebSocket handshake, enabling `?session=`, `?preset=`, and `?readonly` for non-Axum connections
- **Web Frontend: HyperlinkAdded Handler**: Terminal.tsx now handles `hyperlinkAdded` server messages, tracking hyperlinks by row and exposing an `onHyperlinkAdded` callback
- **Web Frontend: UserVarChanged Handler**: Terminal.tsx now handles `userVarChanged` server messages, maintaining a live Map of user variables and exposing an `onUserVarChanged` callback
- **Web Frontend: SelectionChanged Handler**: Terminal.tsx now handles `selectionChanged` server messages, syncing selection state to xterm.js (character and line modes) with automatic clipboard copy, and exposing an `onSelectionChanged` callback
- **Web Frontend: State Tracking**: page.tsx wires new callbacks to store hyperlinks (sliding window of 100) and user vars as React state for future UI consumption
- **Python Bindings: New Config Properties**: `PyStreamingConfig` now exposes `max_clients_per_session` and `input_rate_limit_bytes_per_sec` as constructor params and getter/setter properties
- **Shell Integration: `cursor_line` Field**: `TerminalEvent::ShellIntegrationEvent` now captures the absolute cursor line (`scrollback_len + cursor_row`) at the exact moment each OSC 133 marker is parsed. This enables correct per-marker positioning even when multiple markers arrive in a single frame
- **Shell Integration: `poll_shell_integration_events()`**: New convenience method on `Terminal` drains only shell integration events (keeping others queued), returning `ShellEvent` tuples with cursor position data
- **Shell Integration: `ShellEvent` Type Alias**: New `ShellEvent` type alias `(String, Option<String>, Option<i32>, Option<u64>, Option<usize>)` for typed shell event tuples
- **Streaming Protocol: `cursor_line` in `ShellIntegrationEvent`**: Protobuf and JSON protocol now include `cursor_line` field in shell integration events, propagated through all layers (proto, protocol, server, Python bindings)

### Fixed
- **Streaming Server: Shell Exit Deadlock**: Fixed potential deadlock when shell exits by dropping the PTY mutex guard before calling `close_session()`, and now properly notifies clients with a shutdown message
- **Streaming Server: PTY Write Error Handling**: All PTY write paths (input, mouse, focus, paste) now log errors and increment session error metrics instead of silently ignoring write failures

### Changed
- **BREAKING: `SessionState::try_add_client()`**: Now takes a `max_per_session: usize` parameter (0 = unlimited) instead of unconditionally accepting clients
- **BREAKING: `SessionInfo`**: Now includes five additional metrics fields (`messages_sent`, `bytes_sent`, `input_bytes`, `errors`, `dropped_messages`)
- **Streaming Server: Bounded Output Channel**: Output channel changed from `mpsc::unbounded_channel` to `mpsc::channel(1000)` for backpressure. All senders use `try_send()` instead of `send()`, dropping messages gracefully when the buffer is full
- **Streaming Server: Broadcast Metrics**: `SessionState::broadcast()` now tracks `messages_sent` and `dropped_messages` counters
- **Streaming Server: Idle Reaper Refactored**: Reaper now always runs (not gated by idle timeout config) to support dead session cleanup. Idle timeout reaping is conditional within the unified reaper loop
